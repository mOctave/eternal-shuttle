		description "This ancient shuttle is a model dating back to the Republican era. A small brand on its side declares it to be proudly manufacture by Betelgeuse Shipyards in 3012, making it well over a millenium old. Not much of the original hull remains, but it is a bucket of bolts nonetheless."

conversation "Eternal Shuttle: Beginning"
	`You walk through the corridors of New Horizons 9 for the last time. This station has been your home for the past year, when you weren't in space. Now, however, there is nothing left for you here. The Ashkth have destroyed this system like all the rest, and you alone have escaped their wrath. Now it's time for revenge, and for your name to inspire terror in the hearts of those fell creatures.`
