			`After landing your battered shuttle, you are met by an elderly man wearing an eye patch. He takes one look at your ship and whistles. "It's a miracle you made it here in that." he says, "An unarmed shuttle is easy prey for pirates, let alone the Ashkth. Luckily for you, I can help fix that. It'll be four thousand credits for a laser, and you're not getting one any cheaper than that."`

				`	"Four thousand credits? Is it defective?"`

			`	"No, it's not defective, although it's a bit dusty. To tell you the truth, I'm about ready to bail out of here myself: a couple days later and you'd have missed me. I don't have space for the laser in my hold, and my ship's got better weapons, but you look like you could use it, so I'll give you the chance to buy it off me."`

Finally, the man steps away from your gunport. "Well, there you are. Now, I won't say your chances are good, but they're better than they were. Say, what do you think about travelling with me for a while, to <destination>? I can be ready to leave in three hours."`

			`	Not long after you land, the man with the eye patch meets up with you, accompanied by a short woman with a very dangerous glint in her eye and an assault rifle at her side. "Well," he says, "it was a pleasure flying with you, captain - what did you say your name was again?"`
			`	"<first> <last>," you respond.`
			`	"Right, well, it was a pleasure flying with you. If you ever want to reach me again, just ask for James at the Grey's mercenaries headquarters on Awling. Until then, good luck and good hunting!"`

			`As you're standing by your ship with an armed guard to either side of you, a woman comes running up to you unescorted. "Captain, can you help me?" she asks, although it's more of a demand. "I need to get off this planet as fast as possible. I promise nothing illegal is going on, and I've been cleared to leave by the port authorities. What do you say?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure, I can do that."`
					goto yes
				`	"How much will you pay me?"`
				`	"Why should I take your word for it that you're not involved in anything illegal?"`
					goto illegal
				`	"Sorry, but I can't do that for you."`
					goto no
			`	The woman seems to have been prepared for the question of payment, and is not offended in the least when you ask it. Rather, she relaxes a bit. "I can pay you 20000 credits immediately, on the condition that we're in orbit within the hour, and <payment> upon our arrival on <destination>."`
			choice
				`	"For that, I'll happily do the job."`
					goto yes
				`	"That's a lot of money. How do I know you're not running from the law?"`
				`	"Sorry, but that's not nearly enough for the risk I'd be taking."`
					goto no
			`	"I know it's a lot of money, but the people I'm running from... let's just say that they're nastier than the police by several orders of magnitude. If they get their hands on me, they'd kill me even if everyone on Finite Heaven was there to witness it and the entire Europan Guard was at my back."`
			label illegal
			`	"No, I'm not involved in anything illegal. I won't say I'm the most honest person alive, but I certainly haven't broken any laws. As a matter of fact, I was in government myself up until the world turned upside down." She fishes out a soaking wet and tattered piece of ID bearing a bad picture of her, and some smudged text that seems to include her name. The only thing you can make out is "Security Clearance: A3."`
			choice
				`	"Alright, I can take you off-planet."`
				`	"How can I trust you? For all I know, you could have faked that ID. I'm not taking you anywhere."`
					goto no
			label yes
			`	The woman's face lights up when you tell her you'll take her. "Thank you, captain, thank you. I won't forget what you're doing for me, as sure as my name's Amanda Terran. Here's your payment as agreed, <payment>, which I'll hand over to you so long as we reach orbit within... 59 minutes 43 seconds and counting." With that, she steps past you into your small and battered shuttle, and sits down in the jump seat as you slide into the captain's chair. You just manage to make the one-hour time limit, and receive <payment> for your troubles. Now you just have to make it to <system>.`

			`	When you tell her you won't take her off-planet, the woman's face seems to collapse, and a look of pure terror fills her eyes, just for a moment. Then her composure snaps back into place, and she hurries off to ask another captain to aid her in her escape.`

If you're ever on Kheiron again and need something, just ask around for Representative Terran of Finite Heaven. While we're here, I thought a gift to help make your ship slightly more combat-worthy would be helpful, what with piracy being what it is these days. What do you say to my friends installing armour plating for you?"`

			`The spaceport here is deathly silent, except for the sound of a broadcaster's voice coming from a hyperlink television set that many of the people here are gathered around. The voice continues speaking, "Last night, Representative Amanda Terran of the Finite Heaven government, the leading members of the Progressive party on the planet, was shot in an attack on the Finite Heaven spaceport. A band of marauders took down the fence surrounding the port using high explosives, and proceded to launch a major assault on the guard there, evidently with the aim of assasinating the controverial politician before she could flee the planet. Eight guards are dead, and dozens more hospitalized, but the port infrastructure remains -"`
