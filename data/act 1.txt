			`After landing your battered shuttle, you are met by an elderly man wearing an eye patch. He takes one look at your ship and whistles. "It's a miracle you made it here in that." he says, "An unarmed shuttle is easy prey for pirates, let alone the Ashkth. Luckily for you, I can help fix that. It'll be four thousand credits for a laser, and you're not getting one any cheaper than that."`

I don't have space for the laser in my hold, and my ship's got better weapons, but you look like you could use it, so I'll give you the chance to buy it off me."`

			`	"<first> <last>," you respond.`
			`	"Right, well, it was a pleasure flying with you. If you ever want to reach me again, just ask for James at the Grey's mercenaries headquarters on Awling. Until then, good luck and good hunting!"`

			`As you're standing by your ship with an armed guard to either side of you, a woman comes running up to you unescorted. "Captain, can you help me?" she asks, although it's more of a demand.

					goto no

If they get their hands on me, they'd kill me even if everyone on Finite Heaven was there to witness it and the entire Europan Guard was at my back."`
			label illegal
			`	"No, I'm not involved in anything illegal. I won't say I'm the most honest person alive, but I certainly haven't broken any laws. As a matter of fact, I was in government myself up until the world turned upside down." She fishes out a soaking wet and tattered piece of ID bearing a bad picture of her, and some smudged text that seems to include her name. The only thing you can make out is "Security Clearance: A3."`

Here's your payment as agreed, <payment>, which I'll hand over to you so long as we reach orbit within... 59 minutes 43 seconds and counting." With that, she steps past you into your small and battered shuttle, and sits down in the jump seat as you slide into the captain's chair.
