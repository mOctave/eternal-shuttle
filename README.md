# Eternal Shuttle
---
_What if \<first\> \<last\> never saved the galaxy?_

---
Eternal Shuttle is an entirely new storyline that takes place a thousand years after the events described in Endless Sky. After discovering the secret of jump drives and finding a way to create new hyperlinks, humanity was once again bound for a golden era of exploration. However, the Alphas were still at work, and soon the Republic collapsed and its splinter states warred amongst each other until all that was left to humanity was a small patch of the 35th hyperfabric. If that weren't enough, a new force called the Ashkth has begun destroying star systems.  
Amidst all of this appears a new character, a trash-barge pilot who sees their life destroyed in front of their eyes with the station they called home. Now, \<first\> \<last\> mounts a campaign of revenge against the Ashkth, with the hopes of bringing peace to a dying species.

This is a story of the end of humanity, and of the darker side of human nature. It is a story of murder, betrayal, and generosity all thrown into one. This is a story about how some things change completely and others never do: like the eternal Shuttle.
